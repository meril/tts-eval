# Quick Evaluation Guide

Keep this open while evaluating! 🎧

## The 5 Criteria (1-5 scale)

### 1️⃣ Pronunciation Accuracy
**What:** Are individual words pronounced correctly?

**Listen for:**
- Heteronyms: "lead" (metal) vs "lead" (guide)
- Technical terms: medical drugs, financial jargon
- Foreign words: café, crème brûlée
- Numbers: "4/5/67" as date vs division

**Good (4-5):** All words clear and correct
**Poor (1-2):** Mispronunciations, wrong syllable stress

---

### 2️⃣ Prosody (The Melody/Rhythm)
**What:** Pitch patterns, timing, emphasis

**Listen for:**
- Natural rhythm and flow
- Appropriate pauses (breath groups)
- Emphasis on the right words
- Pitch variation (not monotone)

**Good (4-5):** Natural rhythm, emphasis on right words, appropriate pauses
**Poor (1-2):** Monotone, robotic cadence, wrong word stress, weird pauses

**Example failure:** "The LEAD singer asked the guitarist to LEAD the band" (correct pronunciation, wrong emphasis)

---

### 3️⃣ Emotional Appropriateness
**What:** Does the tone/affect match the content?

**Listen for:**
- Energy level matches text
- Excitement when appropriate
- Seriousness when needed
- Empathy in emotional contexts

**Good (4-5):** Tone fits content naturally
**Poor (1-2):** Flat when should be excited, upbeat when should be serious

**Examples:**
- "Oh my god, that's amazing!" → Should sound excited
- "I'm sorry to tell you..." → Should sound empathetic
- Technical explanation → Should sound clear/neutral

---

### 4️⃣ Naturalness (Human-ness)
**What:** Overall perception - does this sound like a real person?

**Listen for:**
- Voice quality (warm, rich vs tinny, buzzy)
- Absence of artifacts (clicks, glitches, pops)
- Natural breaths (not awkward gasps)
- Vocal texture consistency

**Good (4-5):** Sounds like a real person, warm voice, no weird artifacts
**Poor (1-2):** Robotic quality, tinny/buzzy, clicks, unnatural breaths

**Note:** This is HOLISTIC - it's the "gut feel" of human-ness

---

### 5️⃣ Consistency
**What:** Same quality throughout the utterance

**Listen for:**
- Stable voice quality (no sudden changes)
- Consistent speed/pace
- No voice breaks or glitches mid-sentence
- Volume stays stable

**Good (4-5):** Rock solid throughout
**Poor (1-2):** Quality drops, speed changes, voice breaks

## 🎯 Prosody vs Naturalness - THE KEY DISTINCTION

These are the most confusing! Here's the difference:

| Aspect | Prosody | Naturalness |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Focus** | Melody/rhythm of speech | Overall human-ness |
| **Scope** | Specific (pitch, timing, stress) | Holistic (voice quality, artifacts) |
| **Decomposable?** | Yes (can point to specific words) | No (overall perception) |

### The 2×2 Matrix:

|  | Good Naturalness | Poor Naturalness |
|---|---|---|
| **Good Prosody** | ✅ **Excellent TTS** | Correct emphasis but sounds robotic/synthetic |
| **Poor Prosody** | Sounds human but flat/monotone | ❌ **Old-school TTS** |

### Examples:

**Good Prosody + Poor Naturalness:**
- Perfect rhythm and emphasis
- But voice sounds tinny/buzzy
- Or has weird artifacts/glitches

**Poor Prosody + Good Naturalness:**
- Rich, human-sounding voice
- But speaks in monotone
- Or emphasizes wrong words

## 📝 Evaluation Workflow

### Step 1: First Listen (Pronunciation)
Play both samples once, focus on:
- Are words pronounced correctly?
- Any obvious mispronunciations?

### Step 2: Second Listen (Prosody & Emotion)
Play again, focus on:
- Does the rhythm feel natural?
- Is emphasis on the right words?
- Does tone match the content?

### Step 3: Third Listen (Naturalness & Consistency)
Play one more time:
- Does it sound human overall?
- Any artifacts, clicks, weird breaths?
- Quality stable throughout?

### Step 4: Compare Directly
Play both back-to-back to decide:
- Which sounds better overall?
- What specific differences do you hear?

### Step 5: Take Notes!
Record specific observations:
- "0:03 - weird pause after 'lead'"
- "breath at 0:15 sounds unnatural"
- "emphasis wrong on 'guitarist'"

## 🎓 Common Failure Modes

### Heteronyms (E1 tests)
**What to check:** Is context-dependent pronunciation correct?
- "lead" singer (leed) vs "lead" the band (led)
- "read" past (red) vs "read" future (reed)

### Numbers (E2 tests)
**What to check:** How are numbers/dates spoken?
- "4/5/67" → Should it be a date or a fraction?
- Phone numbers → Natural grouping?
- Percentages → Clear and correct?

### Medical (E4 tests)
**What to check:** Complex terminology
- Drug names: adalimumab, ipratropium
- Diseases: cytomegalovirus pneumonitis
- Empathy in diagnosis delivery

### Prosody (E6 tests)
**What to check:** Long-form naturalness
- Does quality hold for 30+ seconds?
- Emotional shifts handled well?
- Narrative flow feels natural?

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Listen with headphones** - You'll catch more artifacts
2. **Don't overthink it** - Trust your gut reaction
3. **Compare is key** - Play both samples back-to-back
4. **Take breaks** - Listening fatigue is real (every 10 tests)
5. **Note timestamps** - "0:15 - weird breath" is more useful than "sounds off"
6. **Default to 3** - Use full scale: 1=terrible, 3=okay, 5=perfect
7. **Notes are gold** - Future-you will appreciate specifics

## 📊 Scoring Guide

| Score | Meaning | When to Use |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **5** | Perfect | Could be a real human, zero issues |
| **4** | Good | Minor issue but still sounds natural |
| **3** | Okay | Noticeable issues but acceptable |
| **2** | Poor | Multiple problems, sounds synthetic |
| **1** | Terrible | Obvious failures, unusable |

**Don't cluster around 3!** Use the full range.

## 🎯 Remember

- **Prosody** = How it's said (melody, rhythm)
- **Naturalness** = Does it sound human? (quality, artifacts)
- **Both matter** but measure different things!

Good luck with your evaluation! 🎵
